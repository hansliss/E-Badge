# E-Badge
E-Badge IR transmitter

Connect your dongle to a serial port and update the source with this serial port, then run the program.

You can set the speed, number of repeats (0=infinite) and page, where 0 is the initial greeting which will only be shown once, and 1 is the main repeated message.

Thanks to Veit Wahlich for the original e-badge program, which (after I'd realized that it was, in fact, a Perl program and I could stop looking for the source) provided the necessary info on how to send stuff to this thing.
